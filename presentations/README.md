# 🎤 Presentations Archive

This directory stores the **monthly presentations** from the CWT: Crashed While Testing club.  
Each subfolder corresponds to a month and contains slides or notes from different groups.

## 🗓 How It Works
- **Frequency:** Monthly (usually last week of the month)  
- **Format:** Each group gives a **5–10 minute talk** about their paper reviews or projects.  
- **Upload Rule:**  
  - File name: `{group}_slides.pdf` (e.g., `group1_slides.pdf`)  
  - Optional: add a `summary.md` file for highlights
